# PerlKwaliteeInfo
A small app used to display info on the quality of your perl code with links to module POD / info. Built using Mojolicious and inspired in part by Dave Cross. 

The parsing of the modules to pull out inheritance / dependency data is based on work found here - http://technix.github.io/Perl-Analyzer/
